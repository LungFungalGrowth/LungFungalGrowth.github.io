The purpose of the work is to develop a multiscale computational model to simulate the invasion of the human lungs by spores of the opportunistic fungus _Aspergillus fumigatus_. In particular, we explore the role of **nutritional immunity** in clearing  infection, with a focus on iron. This project is currently funded by The National Institutes of Health and The National Science Foundation of the United States of America (see Funding section).

For more information, see [the project wiki](https://github.com/LungFungalGrowth/LungFungalGrowth.github.io/wiki).

The team includes members from [The Center for Quantitative Medicine at UConn Health](https://health.uconn.edu/laubenbacher/), [The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine](https://www.jax.org/about-us/locations/farmington), [UF Health](https://ufhealth.org/), and [Kitware](https://www.kitware.com/).



A particular focus of the project is to ensure reproducible science by using container technology. All data, software tools, and methods will become publicly available as they are developed. As these data and methods are being created by different groups, the wiki and web pages in this repository serve as high-level organizational guide to various resources. These resources include software (simulation and visualization), genomics data, simulation data, associated metadata, experimental lab notebooks, and presentation materials.

## Modular software design
The major innovation that the modeling design implements is the separation of multiscale processes in    to individual "modules." The concept of a module is best understood through an example. Each module is a unique collection of code packaged in a Docker container with its own computational environment, capable of running independently from all others on a separate machine. All model logic is separated into unique modules and the only way the module interact with each other is via writing data to a shared database (Redis). Therefore, we can have a platform which can work with different programming languages and it will be easy to "plug in" or "unplug" a module as long as the module read and write data in a similar way.
