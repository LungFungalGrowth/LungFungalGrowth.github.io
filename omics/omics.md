# Transcriptomics data

## __In vitro__ time-series RNAseq data from monocyte derived dendritic cells exposed to A. fumigatus conidia.
### Description
Monocyte derived dendritic cells from six different human donors (IL-4/GM-CSF differentiated) were exposed to _Aspergillus fumigatus_ conidia with cell:conidia ratio=1:1 for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours. Purity of dendritic cells was confirmed by flow cytometry using CD14-/Cd1a+/HLA+/CD83+.  

### Availability
FASTQ files, experimental notebooks, and processed data is available in the dendritic cell module collection in our [Girder](https://data.computational-biology.org/) instance.

## __In vitro__ time-series RNAseq data from  monocyte derived macrophages exposed to A. fumigatus conidia.
### Description
Monocyte derived macrophages from six different human donors (M-CSF differentiated) were exposed to _Aspergillus fumigatus_ conidia with cell:conidia ratio=1:1 for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours. Purity of macrophages was confirmed by flow cytometry using surface markers CD14+/CD68+/CD163+.
### Availability:
FASTQ files, experimental notebooks, and processed data is available in the macrophage module collection in our [Girder](https://data.computational-biology.org/) instance.
