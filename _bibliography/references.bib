  abstract = {The lungs are vulnerable to attack by respiratory insults such as toxins, allergens, and pathogens, given their continuous exposure to the air we breathe. Our immune system has evolved to provide protection against an array of potential threats without causing collateral damage to the lung tissue. In order to swiftly detect invading pathogens, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs)-together termed mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs)-line the respiratory tract with the key task of surveying the lung microenvironment in order to discriminate between harmless and harmful antigens and initiate immune responses when necessary. Each cell type excels at specific tasks: monocytes produce large amounts of cytokines, macrophages are highly phagocytic, whereas DCs excel at activating naïve T cells. Extensive studies in murine models have established a division of labor between the different populations of MNPs at steady state and during infection or inflammation. However, a translation of important findings in mice is only beginning to be explored in humans, given the challenge of working with rare cells in inaccessible human tissues. Important progress has been made in recent years on the phenotype and function of human lung MNPs. In addition to a substantial population of alveolar macrophages, three subsets of DCs have been identified in the human airways at steady state. More recently, monocyte-derived cells have also been described in healthy human lungs. Depending on the source of samples, such as lung tissue resections or bronchoalveolar lavage, the specific subsets of MNPs recovered may differ. This review provides an update on existing studies investigating human respiratory MNP populations during health and disease. Often, inflammatory MNPs are found to accumulate in the lungs of patients with pulmonary conditions. In respiratory infections or inflammatory diseases, this may contribute to disease severity, but in cancer patients this may improve clinical outcomes. By expanding on this knowledge, specific lung MNPs may be targeted or modulated in order to attain favorable responses that can improve preventive or treatment strategies against respiratory infections, lung cancer, or lung inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract = {Several types of polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) deficiency are a predisposing condition for fatal Aspergillus fumigatus infection. In order to study the defensive role of PMNs in the lungs, with particular reference to PMN recruitment and antimicrobial oxidant activity, responses to pulmonary instillation of A. fumigatus conidia were examined. Responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were compared with those in CXCR2(-/-) and gp91(phox-/-) mice, which are known to have delayed recruitment of PMN to the lungs in response to inflammatory stimuli and inactive NADPH oxidase, respectively. In BALB/c mice, PMNs were recruited to the lungs and formed oxidase-active aggregates with conidia, which inhibited germination. In C57BL/6, gp91(phox-/-), and CXCR2(-/-) mice, PMN recruitment was slower and there was increased germination compared to that in BALB/c mice at 6 and 12 h. In gp91(phox-/-) mice, germination was extensive in PMN aggregates but negligible in alveolar macrophages (AM). Lung sections taken at 6 and 48 h from BALB/c mice showed PMN accumulation at peribronchiolar sites but no germinating conidia. Those from C57BL/6 and CXCR2(-/-) mice showed germinating conidia at 6 h but not at 48 h and few inflammatory cells. In contrast, those from gp91(phox-/-) mice showed germination at 6 h with more-extensive hyphal proliferation and tissue invasion at 48 h. These results indicate that when the lungs are exposed to large numbers of conidia, in addition to the phagocytic activity of AM, early PMN recruitment and formation of oxidative-active aggregates are essential in preventing germination of A. fumigatus conidia.},

Susceptible individuals become infected via the inhalation of dormant conidia. If the immune system fails to clear these conidia, they will swell, germinate and grow into large hyphal structures. Neutrophils are essential effector cells for controlling \emph{A. fumigatus} infection. In general, opsonization of microbial particles is crucial for efficient phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils. Although the antibodies present in human serum do bind to all fungal morphotypes, we observed no direct antibody-mediated phagocytosis of \emph{A. fumigatus}. We show that opsonization, phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils of \emph{A. fumigatus} is complement-dependent. Using human sera depleted of key complement components, we investigated the contribution of the different complement initiation pathways in complement activation on the fungal surface. We describe the classical complement pathway as the main initiator of complement activation on \emph{A. fumigatus} swollen conidia and germ tubes. Antibodies play an important role in complement activation and efficient innate recognition, phagocytosis and killing of \emph{A. fumigatus} by neutrophils.},

DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin that mediates capture and internalization of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens by myeloid dendritic cells. DC-SIGN-interacting pathogens are thought to modulate dendritic cell maturation by interfering with intracellular signaling from Toll-like receptor molecules. We report that engagement of DC-SIGN by specific antibodies does not promote dendritic cell maturation but induces ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation without concomitant p38MAPK activation. DC-SIGN ligation also triggers PLCgamma phosphorylation and transient increases in intracellular calcium in dendritic cells. In agreement with its signaling capabilities, a fraction of DC-SIGN molecules partitions within lipid raft-enriched membrane fractions both in DC-SIGN-transfected and dendritic cells. Moreover, DC-SIGN in dendritic cells coprecipitates with the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. The relevance of the DC-SIGN-initiated signals was demonstrated in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, as DC-SIGN cross-linking synergizes with TNF-alpha for IL-10 release and enhances the production of LPS-induced IL-10. These results demonstrate that DC-SIGN-triggered intracellular signals modulate dendritic cell maturation. Since pathogens stimulate Th2 responses via preferential activation of ERK1/2, these results provide a molecular explanation for the ability of DC-SIGN-interacting pathogens to preferentially evoke Th2-type immune responses.},

  abstract = {Lung epithelial cells constitute the first defense line of host against the inhaled Aspergillus fumigatus; however, the transcriptional response of human alveolar type II epithelial cells was still unclear. Here we used RNA-Seq technology to assess the transcriptome profiles of A549 cells following direct interaction with conidia of A. fumigatus. The total number of identified genes was 19118. Compared with uninfected A549 cells, 459 genes were differentially expressed in cells co-incubated with conidia for 8 h, including 302 up-regulated genes and 157 down-regulated genes. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that most of the up-regulated genes were related to immune response, chemotaxis and inflammatory response and enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, JAK-STAT and MAPK signaling pathways. The down-regulated genes were mainly enriched for terms associated with development, hemopoiesis and ion transport. Among them, EGR4 and HIST1H4J gene had the maximum of fold change in up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. Fourteen up-regulated genes and three down-regulated genes were further validated and significant increase on expression of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in A549 cells were confirmed by qRT-PCR during the interaction of A549 cells with A. fumigatus. Besides, western blot showed that expression of two proteins (ARC, EGR1) significantly increased in A549 cells during interaction with A. fumigatus conidia for 8h. Interference of endogenous expression of ARC or EGR1 protein in A549 cells reduced the internalization of A. fumigatus. These results provided important insights into dynamic changes of gene expression in lung epithelial cells, especially its strong immunological response against A. fumigatus infection.},

Immune responses against these fungi are still not fully understood. Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial players in initiating innate and adaptive immune responses against fungal infections. The immunomodulatory effects of fungi were compared to the bacterial stimulus LPS to determine key players in the immune response to fungal infections. A genome wide study of the gene regulation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) confronted with A. fumigatus, C. albicans or LPS was performed and Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) was identified as the only transcription factor that was down-regulated in DCs by both fungi but induced by stimulation with LPS. Downstream analysis demonstrated the influence of KLF4 on the interleukine-6 expression in human DCs. Furthermore, KLF4 regulation was shown to be dependent on pattern recognition receptor ligation. Therefore KLF4 was identified as a controlling element in the IL-6 immune response with a unique expression pattern comparing fungal and LPS stimulation.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases., Results: To align our large ({$>$}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {$>$}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision.

Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy., Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

  abstract = {Invasive aspergillosis (IA), primarily caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, is an opportunistic fungal infection predominantly affecting immunocompromised and neutropenic patients that is difficult to treat and results in high mortality. Investigations of neutrophil-hypha interaction in vitro and in animal models of IA are limited by lack of temporal and spatial control over interactions. This study presents a new approach for studying neutrophil-hypha interaction at single cell resolution over time, which revealed an evasive fungal behavior triggered by interaction with neutrophils: Interacting hyphae performed de novo tip formation to generate new hyphal branches, allowing the fungi to avoid the interaction point and continue invasive growth. Induction of this mechanism was independent of neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, but could be phenocopied by iron chelation and mechanical or physiological stalling of hyphal tip extension. The consequence of branch induction upon interaction outcome depends on the number and activity of neutrophils available: In the presence of sufficient neutrophils branching makes hyphae more vulnerable to destruction, while in the presence of limited neutrophils the interaction increases the number of hyphal tips, potentially making the infection more aggressive. This has direct implications for infections in neutrophil-deficient patients and opens new avenues for treatments targeting fungal branching., For patients who have compromised immune systems, infection with yeasts and moulds are often deadly. To learn more about how immune cells fight fungal infection, we developed an “infection-on-a-chip” device, which allowed us to directly image interactions in real time. To our surprise, when immune cells attacked the fungi and stalled its growth, the fungi formed new branches, allowing it to avoid the interaction and continue growing. Our hypothesis is that in people with healthy immune cells, forcing the fungi to branch may make it more vulnerable to further attack. However, in patients with impaired immune systems, increasing the number of fungal branches may make the infection more aggressive. By developing new drugs that affect fungal branching, we may be able to give the immune cells of sick patients an advantage in their uphill battle against fungal infection.},

  abstract = {Representatives of the genus Aspergillus are opportunistic fungal pathogens. Their conidia can reach the alveoli by inhalation and can give rise to infections in immunocompromised individuals. Aspergillus fumigatus is the causal agent of invasive aspergillosis in nearly 90\% of the cases. It is not yet well-established what makes this fungus more pathogenic than other aspergilli such as A. niger. Here, we show that A. fumigatus and A. niger conidia adhere with similar efficiency to lung epithelial A549 cells but A. fumigatus conidia internalized 17\% more efficiently. Conidia of both aspergilli were taken up in phagolysosomes 8 h after the challenge. These organelles only acidified in the case of A. niger, which is probably due to the type of melanin coating of the conidia. Viability of both types of conidia was not affected after uptake in the phagolysosomes. Germination of A. fumigatus and A. niger conidia in the presence of epithelial cells was delayed when compared to conidia in the medium. However, germination of A. niger conidia was still higher than that of A. fumigatus 10 h after exposure to A549 cells. Remarkably, A. fumigatus hyphae grew mainly parallel to the epithelium, while growth direction of A. niger hyphae was predominantly perpendicular to the plane of the cells. Neutrophils reduced germination and hyphal growth of A. niger, but not of A fumigatus, in presence of epithelial cells. Taken together, efficient internalization, delayed germination, and hyphal growth parallel to the epithelium gives a new insight into what could be the causes for the success of A. fumigatus compared to A. niger as an opportunistic pathogen in the lung.},

  abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is the most prevalent airborne fungal pathogen and causes fatal invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. Given the essential role of dendritic cells (DC) in initiating and regulating immune responses, we investigated the impact of A. fumigatus conidial infection on human DC. A. fumigatus conidia were rapidly internalized and induced the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha within the first 8 h. After A. fumigatus infection, the majority of DC underwent full maturation, although CCR7 expression was observed only in DC that had internalized the conidia. Additionally, the analysis of regulatory cytokines showed that infected DC simultaneously produced interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70) and significant amounts of IL-10. IL-10 neutralization was not able to further increase IL-12p70 production from infected DC. Whereas the central role of IL-12 in the generation of Th1 cells has long been appreciated, recently two other members of the IL-12 family, IL-23 and IL-27, were reported to play important roles in the regulation of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production from naïve and memory T cells. A. fumigatus-infected DC were also able to express high levels of IL-23p19 and low levels of IL-27p28 at later stages of infection. According to this expression pattern, A. fumigatus-infected DC were able to prime IFN-gamma production of naïve T cells. Thus, this study on the expression of the new IL-12 family members controlling the Th1 response sheds light on a novel aspect of the contribution of DC to anti-Aspergillus immunity.},

Moreover, soluble factors released from A. fumigatus-infected DC increased also the surface expression of two activation markers, CD11b and CD18, on PMN. A. fumigatus infection resulted also in CCL3, CCL4, CXCL10 and CCL20 productions that induce the migration of effector memory Th1 cells. Moreover, the late expression of CCL19 suggests that A. fumigatus-infected DC could be implicated in the migration of CCR7+ naïve T cells and mature DC in lymph nodes. Together these results suggested the involvement of human DC in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity against A. fumigatus through the recruitment of cells active in the fungal destruction.},

The classical short pentraxins, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P component (SAP), are acute-phase proteins produced in the liver in response to inflammatory mediators. Short pentraxins regulate innate resistance to microbes and the scavenging of cellular debris and extracellular matrix components. In contrast, long pentraxins have an unrelated, long amino-terminal domain coupled to the carboxy-terminal pentraxin domain, and differ, with respect to short pentraxins, in their gene organization, chromosomal localization, cellular source, and in their stimuli-inducing and ligand-recognition ability. To investigate the in vivo function of the long pentraxin PTX3, we generated mice deficient in Ptx3 by homologous recombination. Ptx3-null mice were susceptible to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Ptx3 binds selected microbial agents, including conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus, and we found that susceptibility of Ptx3-null mice was associated with defective recognition of conidia by alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as inappropriate induction of an adaptive type 2 response. Thus, the long pentraxin Ptx3 is a secreted pattern-recognition receptor that has a non-redundant role in resistance to selected microbial agents, in particular to the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus.},

This is illustrated by the prevalence of Aspergillus infections in patients with neutropenia or phagocyte functional defects, such as chronic granulomatous disease. However, the mechanisms by which human neutrophils recognize and kill Aspergillus are poorly understood. In this work, we have studied in detail which neutrophil functions, including neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, are involved in the killing of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia and hyphae, using neutrophils from patients with well-defined genetic immunodeficiencies. Recognition of conidia involves integrin CD11b/CD18 (and not dectin-1), which triggers a PI3K-dependent nonoxidative intracellular mechanism of killing. When the conidia escape from early killing and germinate, the extracellular destruction of the Aspergillus hyphae needs opsonization by Abs and involves predominantly recognition via Fcγ receptors, signaling via Syk, PI3K, and protein kinase C to trigger the production of toxic reactive oxygen metabolites by the NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase. A. fumigatus induces NET formation; however, NETs did not contribute to A. fumigatus killing. Thus, our findings reveal distinct killing mechanisms of Aspergillus conidia and hyphae by human neutrophils, leading to a comprehensive insight in the innate antifungal response.},

Depending on the host's immune status, the variety of diseases caused by A. fumigatus ranges from allergies in immunocompetent hosts to life-threatening invasive infections in patients with impaired immunity. In contrast to the majority of other Aspergillus species, which are in most cases nonpathogenic, A. fumigatus features an armory of virulence determinants to establish an infection. For example, A. fumigatus is able to evade the human complement system by binding or degrading complement regulators. Furthermore, the fungus interferes with lung epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophil granulocytes to prevent killing by these immune cells. This chapter summarizes the different strategies of A. fumigatus to manipulate the immune response. We also discuss the potential impact of recent advances in immunoproteomics to improve diagnosis and therapy of an A. fumigatus infection.},

Relatively little is known about early events in the pathogenesis and relationship between the cell wall biomarkers galactomannan and (1→3)-β-d-glucan.

A persistently neutropenic rabbit model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was used to describe the histopathology of early invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and the kinetics of galactomannan and (1→3)-β-d-glucan. The time course of both molecules was mathematically modeled by using a population methodology, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed. The effect of progressive delay in the administration of amphotericin B deoxycholate 1 mg/kg at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postinoculation on fungal burden, lung weight, pulmonary infarct score, and survival was determined. Histopathology showed phagocytosis of conidia by pulmonary alveolar macrophages at 4 h postinoculation. At 12 to 24 h, there was a progressive focal inflammatory response with conidial germination and hyphal extension. Subsequently, hyphae invaded into the contiguous lung. Galactomannan and (1→3)-β-d-glucan had similar trajectories, and both exhibited considerable interindividual variability, which was reflected in Monte Carlo simulations. Concentrations of both molecules began to rise {$<$}24 h postinoculation before pulmonary hemorrhagic infarction was present. Delays of 72 and 96 h in the administration of amphotericin B resulted in fungal burdens and lung weights that were indistinguishable from those of controls, respectively. Galactomannan and (1→3)-β-d-glucan have similar kinetics and are comparable biomarkers of early invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Antifungal treatment at ≥48 h postinoculation is associated with suboptimal therapeutic outcomes.},

Monocyte-derived DCs are poorly migratory antigen-presenting cells that mainly produce proinflammatory chemokines and are necessary for maintaining allergic airway inflammation once initiated. The function of the airway DC network is closely controlled by cytokines released from airway epithelial cells. Airway epithelial cells react to pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns released on allergen inhalation by producing pro-Th2 polarizing cytokines and chemokines that attract and activate DCs. This conceptual framework of epithelial and DC collaboration is very helpful in explaining the process of allergic sensitization and how this is influenced by genetics and environment.},

Its production is stimulated by iron overload and by inflammation. It has been suggested that IL-6 is the only cytokine that stimulates hepcidin transcription. However, mice with targeted disruption of the gene encoding IL-6 (IL-6-/-) respond to endotoxin by increasing the expression of hepcidin transcripts in the liver. We show that incubating murine hepatocytes with IL-6, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta strongly stimulates hepcidin transcription. IL-10 has little or no stimulatory effect, and IFN-beta inhibits transcription of hepcidin. All of the hepcidin stimulatory activity of macrophages from IL-6-/- mice can be accounted for by IL-1 that they secrete. Hepatocytes from IL-6-/- mice, hfe-/- mice, and mice with a hypomorphic transferrin receptor 2 mutation responded to IL-6 and IL-1 by up-regulating hepcidin transcription. Nitric oxide does not seem to be involved in the stimulation of hepcidin transcription by cytokines: aminoguanidine does not inhibit the stimulation of hepcidin transcription by cytokines. IL-1 may play a significant role in the anemia of inflammation by up-regulating hepcidin.},

RC, compared with SC, stimulated significantly less release of both the primary granule marker β-glucuronidase and the secondary granule marker lactoferrin. PMN also phagocytosed significantly greater numbers of SC, although the differences in phagocytosis were not great enough to account for the differences in degranulation. Suboptimal stimulation of degranulation and phagocytosis may thus contribute to the inability of neutrophils to kill RC. Moreover, reagent lactoferrin bound avidly to both RC and SC, raising the possibility that PMN-released lactoferrin may contribute to antifungal activity at the conidial surface by competing for iron or catalyzing the formation of oxygen radicals.},

  abstract = {Siderophores are best known as small iron-binding molecules that facilitate iron uptake in bacteria and fungi. In our previous study, we demonstrated that eukaryotes also produce siderophore-like molecules via a remarkably conserved biosynthetic pathway. A member of the short-chain dehydrogenase family of reductases, 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase-2, catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the biogenesis of the mammalian siderophore. Physiologically, depletion of the mammalian siderophore by inhibiting expression of the 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase-2 gene (Bdh2) results in abnormal accumulation of intracellular iron, increased oxidative stress, and mitochondrial iron deficiency. Thus, the mammalian siderophore is an important regulator of cellular iron homeostasis. The cellular iron storage protein ferritin also regulates iron metabolism and protects cells from oxidative stress. Depletion of ferritin results in intracellular iron accumulation, predisposes to oxidative stress, and confers a growth advantage to cells. We therefore hypothesize that the siderophore and ferritin coregulate cellular iron metabolism/homeostasis in eukaryotes. We tested this prediction by depleting both the siderophore and ferritin. This resulted in a marked accumulation of cellular iron, and caused increased sensitivity to oxidants. Interestingly, cells lacking both the siderophore and ferritin proliferated at a higher rate than cells lacking either of these components alone. Taken together, our findings suggest that the siderophore and ferritin synergistically regulate cellular iron levels.},

  abstract = {Siderophores are best known as small iron binding molecules that facilitate microbial iron transport. In our previous study we identified a siderophore-like molecule in mammalian cells and found that its biogenesis is evolutionarily conserved. A member of the short chain dehydrogenase family of reductases, 3-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase (BDH2) catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the biogenesis of the mammalian siderophore. We have shown that depletion of the mammalian siderophore by inhibiting expression of bdh2 results in abnormal accumulation of cellular iron and mitochondrial iron deficiency. These observations suggest that the mammalian siderophore is a critical regulator of cellular iron homeostasis and facilitates mitochondrial iron import. By utilizing bioinformatics, we identified an iron-responsive element (IRE; a stem-loop structure that regulates genes expression post-transcriptionally upon binding to iron regulatory proteins or IRPs) in the 3'-untranslated region of the human BDH2 (hBDH2) gene. In cultured cells as well as in patient samples we now demonstrate that the IRE confers iron-dependent regulation on hBDH2 and binds IRPs in RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In addition, we show that the hBDH2 IRE associates with IRPs in cells and that abrogation of IRPs by RNAi eliminates the iron-dependent regulation of hBDH2 mRNA. The key physiologic implication is that iron-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of hBDH2 controls mitochondrial iron homeostasis in human cells. These observations provide a new and an unanticipated mechanism by which iron regulates its intracellular trafficking.},

  abstract = {Iron increases the synthesis of the iron-storage protein, ferritin, largely by promoting translation of preexisting mRNAs for both the H and L ferritin isoforms (H, heavy, heart, acidic; L, light, liver, basic). We have recently cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA to murine ferritin H and identified ferritin H as a gene induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha, cachectin). Using primary human myoblasts, we have now examined the relationship between TNF-alpha and iron in regulating ferritin. Four lines of evidence suggest that TNF-alpha regulates ferritin independently of iron. First, evaluation of mRNA showed that TNF-alpha increased ferritin H chain specifically, provoking no change in steady-state levels of ferritin L mRNA; iron, in contrast, increased the mRNA of both isoforms. Second, the increase in ferritin H protein synthesis observed during TNF-alpha treatment was dependent on an increase in ferritin H mRNA: actinomycin D blocked the TNF-alpha-induced changes in ferritin H but did not inhibit the translational induction of ferritin seen with iron treatment. Third, equal ferritin mRNA induction was observed in iron-loaded cells and in cells depleted of iron by a permeant chelator, 2,2'-dipyridyl. Fourth, ferritin H induction by TNF-alpha and iron was additive over the entire range of iron concentrations, even at TNF-alpha doses known to maximally stimulate ferritin H mRNA levels. Nonetheless, the role of iron in translational regulation of ferritin was retained in TNF-alpha-treated cells; effective biosynthesis of TNF-alpha-induced, H-subunit-predominant ferritin protein required iron and could be enhanced by treatment of the cells with additional iron or blocked by 2,2'-dipyridyl. Finally, we observed that the TNF-alpha-mediated increase in ferritin synthesis peaked at 8 hr and was followed by a decrease in both H and L isoferritin synthesis; the addition of iron, however, reversed the late-occurring depression in ferritin synthesis. This suggests that TNF-alpha-induced synthesis of H-rich ferritin may reduce the regulatory pool of intracellular iron, secondarily inhibiting iron-mediated translation of ferritin mRNA. We conclude that TNF-alpha acts independently of iron in its induction of ferritin H mRNA but requires the presence of iron for this effect to be fully expressed at the protein level.},

The present study was designed to investigate the molecular pathways involved in the opsonic activity of PTX3. The PTX3 N-terminal domain was responsible for conidia recognition, but the full-length molecule was necessary for opsonic activity. The PTX3-dependent pathway of enhanced neutrophil phagocytic activity involved complement activation via the alternative pathway; Fcγ receptor (FcγR) IIA/CD32 recognition of PTX3-sensitized conidia and complement receptor 3 (CR3) activation; and CR3 and CD32 localization to the phagocytic cup. Gene targeted mice (ptx3, FcR common γ chain, C3, C1q) validated the in vivo relevance of the pathway. In particular, the protective activity of exogenous PTX3 against A fumigatus was abolished in FcR common γ chain-deficient mice. Thus, the opsonic and antifungal activity of PTX3 is at the crossroad between complement, complement receptor 3-, and FcγR-mediated recognition. Because short pentraxins (eg, C-reactive protein) interact with complement and FcγR, the present results may have general significance for the mode of action of these components of the humoral arm of innate immunity.},

The gene expression patterns of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia or host cells have been reported in a number of previous studies, but each focused on only one of the interacting organisms. In the present study, we profiled simultaneously the transcriptional response of both A. fumigatus and human airway epithelial cells (AECs). Methodology 16HBE14o- transformed bronchial epithelial cells were incubated with A. fumigatus conidia at 37°C for 6 hours, followed by genome-wide transcriptome analysis using human and fungal microarrays. Differentially expressed gene lists were generated from the microarrays, from which biologically relevant themes were identified. Human and fungal candidate genes were selected for validation, using RT-qPCR, in both 16HBE14o- cells and primary AECs co-cultured with conidia. Principal Findings We report that ontologies related to the innate immune response are activated by co-incubation with A. fumigatus condia, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was confirmed to be up-regulated in primary AECs via RT-qPCR. Concomitantly, A. fumigatus was found to up-regulate fungal pathways involved in iron acquisition, vacuolar acidification, and formate dehydrogenase activity. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a dual organism transcriptomics approach to interactions of A. fumigatus conidia and human airway epithelial cells. The up-regulation of IL-6 by epithelia and simultaneous activation of several pathways by fungal conidia warrants further investigation as we seek to better understand this interaction in both health and disease. The cellular response of the airway epithelium to A. fumigatus is important to understand if we are to improve host-pathogen outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invasive aspergillosis is a severe infection of immunocompromised hosts, caused by the inhalation of the spores of the ubiquitous environmental molds of the Aspergillus genus. The innate immune response in this infection entails a series of complex and inter-related interactions between multiple recruited and resident cell populations with each other and with the fungal cell; in particular, iron is critical for fungal growth.
RESULTS: A computational model of invasive aspergillosis is presented here; the model can be used as a rational hypothesis-generating tool to investigate host responses to this infection. Using a combination of laboratory data and published literature, an in silico model of a section of lung tissue was generated that includes an alveolar duct, adjacent capillaries, and surrounding lung parenchyma. The three-dimensional agent-based model integrates temporal events in fungal cells, epithelial cells, monocytes, and neutrophils after inhalation of spores with cellular dynamics at the tissue level, comprising part of the innate immune response. Iron levels in the blood and tissue play a key role in the fungus' ability to grow, and the model includes iron recruitment and consumption by the different types of cells included. Parameter sensitivity analysis suggests the model is robust with respect to unvalidated parameters, and thus is a viable tool for an in silico investigation of invasive aspergillosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Using laboratory data from a mouse model of invasive aspergillosis in the context of transient neutropenia as validation, the model predicted qualitatively similar time course changes in fungal burden, monocyte and neutrophil populations, and tissue iron levels. This model lays the groundwork for a multi-scale dynamic mathematical model of the immune response to Aspergillus species.},

The mechanism is posttranscriptional and involves two cytoplasmic iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2. Under conditions of iron starvation, IRPs stabilize the transferrin receptor and inhibit the translation of ferritin mRNAs by binding to "iron responsive elements" (IREs) within their untranslated regions. The IRE/IRP system also controls the expression of additional IRE-containing mRNAs, encoding proteins of iron and energy metabolism. The activities of IRP1 and IRP2 are regulated by distinct posttranslational mechanisms in response to cellular iron levels. Thus, in iron-replete cells, IRP1 assembles a cubane iron-sulfur cluster, which prevents IRE binding, while IRP2 undergoes proteasomal degradation. IRP1 and IRP2 also respond, albeit differentially, to iron-independent signals, such as hydrogen peroxide, hypoxia, or nitric oxide. Basic principles of the IRE/IRP system and recent advances in understanding the regulation and the function of IRP1 and IRP2 are discussed.},

This suggests that for most healthy humans, innate immunity is sufficient to clear the organism. A failure of these defenses results in a uniquely diverse set of illnesses caused by Aspergillus species, which includes diseases caused by the colonization of the respiratory tract, invasive infection, and hypersensitivity. A key concept in immune responses to Aspergillus species is that the susceptibilities of the host determine the morphological form, antigenic structure, and physical location of the fungus. In this review, we summarize the current literature on the multiple layers of innate defenses against Aspergillus species that dictate the outcome of this host-microbe interaction.},

It has previously been reported that invasive aspergillosis, a prototypic opportunistic infection in neutropenic hosts, is associated with marked accumulation of inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) in the lungs. Given recent data indicating that neutrophils can modulate immune responses independent of their direct microbial killing, we hypothesized that neutropenia impacts the host response to Aspergillus by determining the migration and phenotype of lung DCs. Inflammatory DCs, but not other DC subsets, were found to accumulate in the lungs of neutropenic hosts challenged with killed or live-attenuated Aspergillus as compared with nonneutropenic hosts, indicating that the accumulation was independent of neutrophil microbicidal activity. The mechanism of this accumulation in neutropenic hosts was found to be augmented influx of DCs, or their precursors, from the blood to the lungs. This effect was attributable to greatly elevated lung TNF expression in neutropenic as compared with nonneutropenic animals. This resulted in greater lung expression of the chemokine ligands CCL2 and CCL20, which, in turn, mediated enhanced recruitment of TNF-producing inflammatory DCs, resulting in a positive feedback cycle. Finally, in the context of neutropenic invasive aspergillosis, depletion of DCs resulted in impaired fungal clearance, indicating that this mechanism is protective for the host. These observations identify what we believe is a novel defense mechanism in invasive aspergillosis that is the result of alterations in DC traffic and phenotype and is specific to neutropenic hosts.},

Neutropenia has previously been associated with enhanced influx of CD11b-expressing conventional dendritic cells to the lungs in response to Aspergillus species, but whether neutrophils directly modulate the function of dendritic cells in this infection is not known. We hypothesized that, in the setting of intrapulmonary challenge with Aspergillus, neutrophils promote the maturation and traffic of lung conventional dendritic cells to draining mediastinal lymph nodes. We report that neutropenia results in a marked accumulation of dendritic cells in the lungs of mice challenged with Aspergillus but greatly diminishes their egress to mediastinal lymph nodes independent of neutrophil microbicidal functions. Furthermore, the phenotype of lung dendritic cells was more immature in neutropenic animals than in nonneutropenic mice exposed to the microorganism. Consistent with this, coincubation with neutrophils greatly enhanced the upregulation of costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells exposed to Aspergillus in vitro, a process that was dependent on cell contact and the dendritic cell receptor DC-SIGN. Taken together, our data support an immunomodulatory cross talk between neutrophils and dendritic cells in the context of host response to Aspergillus that promotes the maturation and efflux of lung dendritic cells.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis and mechanisms of killing of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia by murine alveolar macrophages (AM), which are the main phagocytic cells of the innate immunity of the lung, were investigated. Engulfment of conidia by murine AM lasts 2 h. Killing of A. fumigatus conidia by AM begins after 6 h of phagocytosis. Swelling of the conidia inside the AM is a prerequisite for killing of conidia. The contributions of NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase to the conidicidal activity of AM were studied using AM from OF1, wild-type and congenic p47phox(-/-) 129Sv, and wild-type and congenic iNOS(-/-) C57BL/6 mice. AM from p47phox(-/-) mice were unable to kill A. fumigatus conidia. Inhibitors of NADPH oxidase that decreased the production of reactive oxidant intermediates inhibited the killing of A. fumigatus without altering the phagocytosis rate. In contrast to NADPH oxidase, nitric oxide synthase does not play a role in killing of conidia. Corticosteroids did not alter the internalization of conidia by AM but did inhibit the production of reactive oxidant intermediates and the killing of A. fumigatus conidia by AM. Impairment of production of reactive oxidant intermediates by corticosteroids is responsible for the development of invasive aspergillosis in immunosuppressed mice.},

  abstract = {Agent-based simulations are an increasingly popular means of exploring and understanding complex social systems. In order to be useful, these simulations must capture a range of aspects of the modeled situation, each possibly requiring distinct expertise. Moreover, different paradigms may be useful in modelling, ranging from those that use many lightweight reactive agents, to those that use cognitive agents, to those that focus on agent teams and organisational structures. There is need for an architecture which supports the development of a large simulation, through the integration of separately developed modules. This paper describes a framework and architecture which facilitates the integration of multiple agent-based simulations into a single global simulation. This architecture naturally supports distributed simulation and incremental development, which are ways of addressing the computational and conceptual complexity of such systems. In this paper we focus particularly on how to ensure proper management of simulation data that is affected by agents in different modules, at the same logical time. We also provide some preliminary performance evaluation addressing scalability, as well as a comparison of how other available systems handle the issue of shared data},

  abstract = {The ubiquitous mold Aspergillus fumigatus threatens immunosuppressed patients as inducer of lethal invasive aspergillosis. A. fumigatus conidia are airborne and reach the alveoli, where they encounter alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). Previous studies reported the importance of the surfactant-producing AEC II during A. fumigatus infection via in vitro experiments using cell lines. We established a negative isolation protocol yielding untouched primary murine AEC II with a purity {$>$}90\%, allowing ex vivo analyses of the cells, which encountered the mold in vivo. By label-free proteome analysis of AEC II isolated from mice 24h after A. fumigatus or mock infection we quantified 2256 proteins and found 154 proteins to be significantly differentially abundant between both groups (ANOVA p value ≤ 0.01, ratio of means ≥1.5 or ≤0.67, quantified with ≥2 peptides). Most of these proteins were higher abundant in the infected condition and reflected a comprehensive activation of AEC II on interaction with A. fumigatus. This was especially represented by proteins related to oxidative phosphorylation, hence energy production. However, the most strongly induced protein was the l-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) Interleukin 4 induced 1 (IL4I1) with a 42.9 fold higher abundance (ANOVA p value 2.91−10). IL4I1 has previously been found in B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and rare neurons. Increased IL4I1 abundance in AEC II was confirmed by qPCR, Western blot and immunohistology. Furthermore, A. fumigatus infected lungs showed high levels of IL4I1 metabolic products. Importantly, higher IL4I1 abundance was also confirmed in lung tissue from human aspergilloma. Because LAAO are key enzymes for bactericidal product generation, AEC II might actively participate in pathogen defense. We provide insights into proteome changes of primary AEC II thereby opening new avenues to analyze the molecular changes of this central lung cell on infectious threats.

  abstract = {The saprophytic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is the most prevalent airborne fungal pathogen, which is responsible for invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. Iron plays an essential role for the growth and proliferation of A. fumigatus. This fungus synthesizes three major siderophores. It excretes triacetylfusarinine C to capture iron, while it accumulates ferricrocin and hydroxyferricrocin for hyphal and conidial iron storage, respectively. Herein, we investigated the role of the siderophore system of A. fumigatus in the modulation of immune effector pathways and iron homeostasis in macrophages. We set up a co-culture system consisting of the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and either A. fumigatus wild type or a siderophore-deficient mutant (DeltasidA). We used real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses to study the expression of macrophage iron metabolism and innate immune response genes in response to pathogen challenge. Infection of macrophages with A. fumigatus wild type, but not with the DeltasidA mutant, induced expression of TNF and phagocyte oxidase subunit 47 at the transcriptional level. Moreover, infection with A. fumigatus wild type, but not with the DeltasidA mutant, compromised macrophage iron homeostasis. Infection with wild-type A. fumigatus decreased expression of the two cellular iron importers, the divalent metal transporter-1 and the transferrin receptor, and the only known iron exporter ferroportin. At the same time, it increased macrophage iron retention and ferritin synthesis. These data indicate that A. fumigatus affects the regulation of macrophage iron homeostasis and innate immune effector pathways via its siderophore system. The changes in immune response may be a consequence of macrophage iron restriction.},

  abstract = {Alveolar macrophages represent a first-line innate host defense mechanism for clearing inhaled Aspergillus fumigatus from the lungs, yet contradictory data exist as to which alveolar macrophage recognition receptor is critical for innate immunity to A. fumigatus. Acknowledging that the A. fumigatus cell wall contains a high beta-1,3-glucan content, we questioned whether the beta-glucan receptor dectin-1 played a role in this recognition process. Monoclonal antibody, soluble receptor, and competitive carbohydrate blockage indicated that the alveolar macrophage inflammatory response, specifically the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2/macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte monocyte-CSF (GM-CSF), to live A. fumigatus was dependent on recognition via the beta-glucan receptor dectin-1. The inflammatory response was triggered at the highest level by A. fumigatus swollen conidia and early germlings and correlated to the levels of surface-exposed beta glucans, indicating that dectin-1 preferentially recognizes specific morphological forms of A. fumigatus. Intratracheal administration of A. fumigatus conidia to mice in the presence of a soluble dectin-Fc fusion protein reduced both lung proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels and cellular recruitment while modestly increasing the A. fumigatus fungal burden, illustrating the importance of beta-glucan-initiated dectin-1 signaling in defense against this pathogen. Collectively, these data show that dectin-1 is centrally required for the generation of alveolar macrophage proinflammatory responses to A. fumigatus and to our knowledge provides the first in vivo evidence for the role of dectin-1 in fungal innate defense.},

  abstract = {The haptoglobin- (Hp-) CD163-heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is an efficient captor-receptor-enzyme system to circumvent the hemoglobin (Hb)/heme-induced toxicity during physiological and pathological hemolyses. In this pathway, Hb tightly binds to Hp leading to CD163-mediated uptake of the complex in macrophages followed by lysosomal Hp-Hb breakdown and HO-1-catalyzed conversion of heme into the metabolites carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin, and iron. The plasma concentration of Hp is a limiting factor as evident during accelerated hemolysis, where the Hp depletion may cause serious Hb-induced toxicity and put pressure on backup protecting systems such as the hemopexin-CD91-HO pathway. The Hp-CD163-HO-1 pathway proteins are regulated by the acute phase mediator interleukin-6 (IL-6), but other regulatory factors indicate that this upregulation is a counteracting anti-inflammatory response during inflammation. The heme metabolites including bilirubin converted from biliverdin have overall an anti-inflammatory effect and thus reinforce the anti-inflammatory efficacy of the Hp-CD163-HO-1 pathway. Future studies of animal models of inflammation should further define the importance of the pathway in the anti-inflammatory response.},

An impaired immune system renders the body vulnerable to invasive mycoses that often lead to the death of the patient. While the number of immunocompromised patients is rising with medical progress, the process, and dynamics of defense against invaded and ready to germinate fungal conidia are still insufficiently understood. Besides macrophages, neutrophil granulocytes form an important line of defense in that they clear conidia. Live imaging shows the interaction of those phagocytes and conidia as a dynamic process of touching, dragging, and phagocytosis. To unravel strategies of phagocytes on the hunt for conidia an agent-based modeling approach is used, implemented in NetLogo. Different modes of movement of phagocytes are tested regarding their clearing efficiency: random walk, short-term persistence in their recent direction, chemotaxis of chemokines excreted by conidia, and communication between phagocytes. While the short-term persistence hunting strategy turned out to be superior to the simple random walk, following a gradient of chemokines released by conidial agents is even better. The advantage of communication between neutrophilic agents showed a strong dependency on the spatial scale of the focused area and the distribution of the pathogens.},

  abstract = {Hemopexin (HPX) is the plasma protein with the highest binding affinity to heme among known proteins. It is mainly expressed in liver, and belongs to acute phase reactants, the synthesis of which is induced after inflammation. Heme is potentially highly toxic because of its ability to intercalate into lipid membrane and to produce hydroxyl radicals. The binding strength between heme and HPX, and the presence of a specific heme-HPX receptor able to catabolize the complex and to induce intracellular antioxidant activities, suggest that hemopexin is the major vehicle for the transportation of heme in the plasma, thus preventing heme-mediated oxidative stress and heme-bound iron loss. In this review, we discuss the experimental data that support this view and show that the most important physiological role of HPX is to act as an antioxidant after blood heme overload, rather than to participate in iron metabolism. Particular attention is also put on the structure of the protein and on its regulation during the acute phase reaction.},

  abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is a wide-spread fungus that is a potent allergen in hypersensitive individuals but also an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. It reproduces asexually by releasing airborne conidiospores (conidia). Upon inhalation, fungal conidia are capable of reaching the airway epithelial cells (AECs) in bronchial and alveolar tissues. Previous studies have predominantly used submerged monolayer cultures for studying this host-pathogen interaction; however, these cultures do not recapitulate the mucocililary differentiation phenotype of the in vivo epithelium in the respiratory tract. Thus, the aim of this study was to use well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) grown at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to determine their transcriptomic and proteomic responses following interaction with A. fumigatus conidia. We visualized conidial interaction with HBECs using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and applied NanoString nCounter and shotgun proteomics to assess gene expression changes in the human cells upon interaction with A. fumigatus conidia. Western blot analysis was used to assess the expression of top three differentially expressed proteins, CALR, SET and NUCB2. CLSM showed that, unlike submerged monolayer cultures, well-differentiated ALI cultures of primary HBECs were estimated to internalize less than 1\% of bound conidia. Nevertheless, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed numerous differentially expressed host genes; these were enriched for pathways including apoptosis/autophagy, translation, unfolded protein response and cell cycle (up-regulated); complement and coagulation pathways, iron homeostasis, nonsense mediated decay and rRNA binding (down-regulated). CALR and SET were confirmed to be up-regulated in ALI cultures of primary HBECs upon exposure to A. fumigatus via western blot analysis. Therefore, using transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, ALI models recapitulating the bronchial epithelial barrier in the conductive zone of the respiratory tract can provide novel insights to the molecular response of bronchial epithelial cells upon exposure to A. fumigatus conidia.},

Treatment of exponentially growing MRC5 cells with these cytokines led to a 3-4-fold increase in transferrin receptor mRNA and a coordinate increase in transferrin receptor protein by 24 h. Under these conditions, stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation was minimal, suggesting that the induction of transferrin receptor by TNF and IL-1 is mediated by a growth-independent regulatory mechanism. A study of the time course of this response showed that cytokine-mediated increases in transferrin receptor mRNA and protein proceeded after a lag of 12-24 h. A simultaneous analysis of the effects of TNF and IL-1 on ferritin in MRC5 cells was also performed. Ferritin L mRNA levels were unchanged. However, induction of ferritin H mRNA was seen within 4 h, preceding the induction of the transferrin receptor. The synthesis of ferritin H (but not ferritin L) protein peaked at 8 h after TNF or IL-1 treatment, followed by a rapid decrease in both ferritin H and L protein synthesis. As ferritin H synthesis declined, levels of transferrin receptor protein increased, reaching a maximum by 24 h. These results suggest that the cytokine-dependent induction of ferritin H and subsequent increase in the transferrin receptor are related and possibly interdependent events. This study demonstrates that the complex role of TNF and IL-1 in iron homeostasis includes modulation of the transferrin receptor.},

  abstract = {We investigated the role of the β-glucan receptor, Dectin-1, in the response of human neutrophils to unopsonized Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its major β-glucan-containing capsular constituent, zymosan. Although reported to be indispensable for yeast phagocytosis in murine phagocytes, human Dectin-1 was not involved in the phagocytosis of S. cerevisiae or zymosan by human neutrophils. Phagocytosis of yeast particles proved to be completely dependent on CD11b/CD18, also known as complement receptor 3 (CR3). The findings were supported by data with neutrophils from a patient suffering from Leukocyte-Adhesion Deficiency type-1 (LAD-1) syndrome lacking CD11b/CD18. In addition, neither the priming by zymosan of the fMLP-induced NADPH-oxidase activity in human neutrophils nor the secretion of IL-8 by human neutrophils in response to zymosan preparations was affected by blocking anti-Dectin-1 antibodies or laminarin as a monovalent inhibitor. As shown by neutrophils from an IRAK-4-deficient patient, the zymosan-induced IL-8 release was also independent of TLR2. In summary, our data show that Dectin-1, although indispensable for recognition of β-glucan-bearing particles in mice, is not the major receptor for yeast particles in human neutrophils.},

Studies suggest that there are two sources of hepcidin in the brain; one is local and the other comes from the circulation. Little is known about the molecular mediators of local hepcidin expression, but inflammation and iron-load have been shown to induce hepcidin expression in the brain. The most important source of hepcidin in the brain are glial cells. Role of hepcidin in brain functions has been observed during neuronal iron-load and brain hemorrhage, where secretion of abundant hepcidin is related with the severity of brain damage. This damage can be reversed by blocking systemic and local hepcidin secretion. Studies have yet to unveil its role in other brain conditions, but the rationale exists, since these conditions are characterized by overexpression of the factors that stimulate brain hepcidin expression, such as inflammation, hypoxia and iron-overload.},

  abstract = {NADPH oxidase is a crucial enzyme in mediating antimicrobial host defense and in regulating inflammation. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease, an inherited disorder of NADPH oxidase in which phagocytes are defective in generation of reactive oxidant intermediates (ROIs), suffer from life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. The mechanisms by which NADPH oxidase mediate host defense are unclear. In addition to ROI generation, neutrophil NADPH oxidase activation is linked to the release of sequestered proteases that are posited to be critical effectors of host defense. To definitively determine the contribution of NADPH oxidase versus neutrophil serine proteases, we evaluated susceptibility to fungal and bacterial infection in mice with engineered disruptions of these pathways. NADPH oxidase-deficient mice (p47phox−/−) were highly susceptible to pulmonary infection with Aspergillus fumigatus. In contrast, double knockout neutrophil elastase (NE)−/−×cathepsin G (CG)−/− mice and lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin C/dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI)-deficient mice that are defective in neutrophil serine protease activation demonstrated no impairment in antifungal host defense. In separate studies of systemic Burkholderia cepacia infection, uniform fatality occurred in p47phox−/− mice, whereas NE−/−×CG−/− mice cleared infection. Together, these results show a critical role for NADPH oxidase in antimicrobial host defense against A. fumigatus and B. cepacia, whereas the proteases we evaluated were dispensable. Our results indicate that NADPH oxidase dependent pathways separate from neutrophil serine protease activation are required for host defense against specific pathogens.},

  abstract = {Heme oxygenase (HO)-1, the inducible isoform of the heme-degrading enzyme HO, plays a critical role in inflammation and iron homeostasis. Regulatory functions of HO-1 are mediated via the catalytic breakdown of heme, which is an iron-containing tetrapyrrole complex with potential pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects. In addition, the HO reaction produces the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin, subsequently converted into bilirubin, along with iron, which is reutilized for erythropoiesis. HO-1 is up-regulated by a plethora of stimuli and injuries in most cell types and tissues and provides salutary effects by restoring physiological homeostasis. Notably, HO-1 exhibits critical immuno-modulatory functions in macrophages, which are a major cell population of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Macrophages play key roles as sentinels and regulators of the immune system and HO-1 in these cells appears to be of critical importance for driving resolution of inflammatory responses. In this review, the complex functions and regulatory mechanisms of HO-1 in macrophages will be high-lighted. A particular focus will be the intricate interactions of HO-1 with its substrate heme, which play a contradictory role in distinct physiological and pathophysiological settings. The therapeutic potential of targeted modulation of the macrophage heme-HO-1 system will be discussed in the context of inflammatory disorders.},

  abstract = {ZIP8 (SLC39A8) belongs to the ZIP family of metal-ion transporters. Among the ZIP proteins, ZIP8 is most closely related to ZIP14, which can transport iron, zinc, manganese, and cadmium. Here we investigated the iron transport ability of ZIP8, its subcellular localization, pH dependence, and regulation by iron. Transfection of HEK 293T cells with ZIP8 cDNA enhanced the uptake of (59)Fe and (65)Zn by 200 and 40\%, respectively, compared with controls. Excess iron inhibited the uptake of zinc and vice versa. In RNA-injected Xenopus oocytes, ZIP8-mediated (55)Fe(2+) transport was saturable (K(0.5) of ∼0.7 μm) and inhibited by zinc. ZIP8 also mediated the uptake of (109)Cd(2+), (57)Co(2+), (65)Zn(2+) {$>$} (54)Mn(2+), but not (64)Cu (I or II). By using immunofluorescence analysis, we found that ZIP8 expressed in HEK 293T cells localized to the plasma membrane and partially in early endosomes. Iron loading increased total and cell-surface levels of ZIP8 in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. We also determined by using site-directed mutagenesis that asparagine residues 40, 88, and 96 of rat ZIP8 are glycosylated and that N-glycosylation is not required for iron or zinc transport. Analysis of 20 different human tissues revealed abundant ZIP8 expression in lung and placenta and showed that its expression profile differs markedly from ZIP14, suggesting nonredundant functions. Suppression of endogenous ZIP8 expression in BeWo cells, a placental cell line, reduced iron uptake by ∼40\%, suggesting that ZIP8 participates in placental iron transport. Collectively, these data identify ZIP8 as an iron transport protein that may function in iron metabolism.},

A critical step in the establishment of infection is the invasion of airway epithelial cells by the inhaled fungi. Understanding how A. fumigatus senses and responds to airway cells is important to understand the pathogenesis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Here, we analysed the transcriptomes of two commonly used clinical isolates, Af293 and CEA10, during infection of the A549 type II pneumocyte cell line in vitro. We focused our RNA-seq analysis on the core set of genes that are present in the genomes of the two strains. Our results suggest that: (a) A. fumigatus does not mount a conserved transcriptional response to airway epithelial cells in our in vitro model and (b) strain background and time spent in the tissue culture media have a greater impact on the transcriptome than the presence of host cells. Our analyses reveal both common and strain-specific transcriptional programmes that allow for the generation of hypotheses about gene function as it pertains to pathogenesis and the significant phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed among A. fumigatus isolates.},

Hepcidin levels that are inappropriately low or high result in iron overload or iron deficiency, respectively. Although hypoxia, erythroid demand, iron, and inflammation are all known to influence hepcidin expression, the mechanisms responsible are not well defined. In this report we show that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) directly regulates hepcidin through induction and subsequent promoter binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). STAT3 is necessary and sufficient for the IL-6 responsiveness of the hepcidin promoter. Our findings provide a mechanism by which hepcidin can be regulated by inflammation or, in the absence of inflammatory stimuli, by alternative mechanisms leading to STAT3 activation.},

  abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus, a common mold, rarely infects humans, except during prolonged neutropenia or in cases of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the NADPH oxidase that normally produces fungicidal reactive oxygen species. Filamentous hyphae of Aspergillus are killed by normal, but not CGD polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN); however, the few studies on PMN-mediated host defenses against infectious conidia (spores) of this organism have yielded conflicting results, some showing that PMN do not inhibit conidial growth, with others showing that they do, most likely using reactive oxygen species. Given that CGD patients are exposed daily to hundreds of viable A. fumigatus conidia, yet considerable numbers of them survive years without infection, we reasoned that PMN use ROS-independent mechanisms to combat Aspergillus. We show that human PMN from both normal controls and CGD patients are equipotent at arresting the growth of Aspergillus conidia in vitro, indicating the presence of a reactive oxygen species-independent factor(s). Cell-free supernatants of degranulated normal and CGD neutrophils both suppressed fungal growth and were found to be rich in lactoferrin, an abundant PMN secondary granule protein. Purified iron-poor lactoferrin at concentrations occurring in PMN supernatants (and reported in human mucosal secretions in vivo) decreased fungal growth, whereas saturation of lactoferrin or PMN supernatants with iron, or testing in the presence of excess iron in the form of ferritin, completely abolished activity against conidia. These results demonstrate that PMN lactoferrin sequestration of iron is important for host defense against Aspergillus.},
