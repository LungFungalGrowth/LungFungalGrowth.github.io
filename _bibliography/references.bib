  abstract	= {Summary: All humans are continuously exposed to inhaled
		  Aspergillus conidia, yet healthy hosts clear the organism
		  without developing disease and without the development of
		  antibody- or cell-mediated acquired immunity to this
		  organism. This suggests that for most healthy humans,
		  innate immunity is sufficient to clear the organism. A
		  failure of these defenses results in a uniquely diverse set
		  of illnesses caused by Aspergillus species, which includes
		  diseases caused by the colonization of the respiratory
		  tract, invasive infection, and hypersensitivity. A key
		  concept in immune responses to Aspergillus species is that
		  the susceptibilities of the host determine the
		  morphological form, antigenic structure, and physical
		  location of the fungus. In this review, we summarize the
		  current literature on the multiple layers of innate
		  defenses against Aspergillus species that dictate the
		  outcome of this host-microbe interaction.},

  abstract	= {Opportunistic human pathogenic fungi like the ubiquitous
		  fungus Aspergillus fumigatus are a major threat to
		  immunocompromised patients. An impaired immune system
		  renders the body vulnerable to invasive mycoses that often
		  lead to the death of the patient. While the number of
		  immunocompromised patients is rising with medical progress,
		  the process, and dynamics of defense against invaded and
		  ready to germinate fungal conidia are still insufficiently
		  understood. Besides macrophages, neutrophil granulocytes
		  form an important line of defense in that they clear
		  conidia. Live imaging shows the interaction of those
		  phagocytes and conidia as a dynamic process of touching,
		  dragging, and phagocytosis. To unravel strategies of
		  phagocytes on the hunt for conidia an agent-based modeling
		  approach is used, implemented in {NetLogo}. Different modes
		  of movement of phagocytes are tested regarding their
		  clearing efficiency: random walk, short-term persistence in
		  their recent direction, chemotaxis of chemokines excreted
		  by conidia, and communication between phagocytes. While the
		  short-term persistence hunting strategy turned out to be
		  superior to the simple random walk, following a gradient of
		  chemokines released by conidial agents is even better. The
		  advantage of communication between neutrophilic agents
		  showed a strong dependency on the spatial scale of the
		  focused area and the distribution of the pathogens.},
