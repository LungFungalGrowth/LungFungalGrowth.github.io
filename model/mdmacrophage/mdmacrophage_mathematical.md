## Modeling iron handling by monocyte derived macrophages challenged by _A. fumigatus_
Iron is essential for all living organisms. A characteristic immune response to infections is the sequestration of iron by macrophages to keep it away from pathogens. We have created a generalized Boolean model of how monocyte derived activate an iron metabolism program after sensing _A. fumigatus_ based on the transcriptomics data (see the Bioinformatics section) as well as the literature.

The code for the implementation of the intracellular model, as well as a more thorough description can be found [here](https://github.com/NutritionalLungImmunity/NLI_macrophage_iron_regulation).
