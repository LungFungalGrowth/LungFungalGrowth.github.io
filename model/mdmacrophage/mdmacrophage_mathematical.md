# Mathematical model
Iron is essential for all living organisms. A characteristic immune response to infections is the sequestration of iron by macrophages to keep it away from pathogens. We have created a generalized Boolean model of how monocyte derived activate an iron metabolism program after sensing _A. fumigatus_ based on the transcriptomics data (see the Bioinformatics section) as well as the literature.
