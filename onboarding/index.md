## First steps

1. Go to our to [Girder data management](https://data.nutritionallungimmunity.org/#?dialog=register)to register for access to our information data management platform.
1. Request membership in our Nutritional Lung Immunity [Github organization](https://github.com/NutritionalLungImmunity).
1. Get a [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) account and send [Luis Sordo Vieira](mailto:luis.sordovieira@medicine.ufl.edu) an email to get access to our Zotero group.

### Read the directions for asset management.

We use the [Girder data management platform](https://data.nutritionallungimmunity.org) for asset management (e.g. FASTQ files), [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) for reference management, and [Github](https://github.com/NutritionalLungImmunity) for code management. Head [here](/onboarding/asset-management-directions) for instructions on how to use these tools.
